# Service Now Incident Beautifier
This is a little userscript I made to remove extraneous details from the Incident Information tab of incident pages. This script detects and removes extra information from comments on tickets that include previous email replies. Instead of having to scroll back and forth to look at different messages in a ticket, this script collapses the extra replies and replaces them with a button to show them again.
## See the [wiki](https://github.com/IncPlusPlus/Service-Now-Incident-Beautifier/wiki/Home) for installation instructions, usage information, frequently asked questions, and common concerns that I can clear up

[SCREENSHOTS OF THIS IN ACTION WILL BE POSTED AS SOON AS THEY ARE APPROVED]
