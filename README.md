# Service Now Incident Beautifier
A little userscript I made to remove extraneous details from the Incident Information tab of incident pages.
This script detects and removes extra information from comments on tickets that include previous email replies.
Instead of having to scroll back and forth to look at different messages in a ticket, this script collapses the extra replies and replaces them with a button to show them again.
[SCREENSHOTS OF THIS IN ACTION WILL BE POSTED AS SOON AS THEY ARE APPROVED]
## Concerned with what this software could possibly do to your computer?
As long as you follow the installation instructions, I can guarantee that no harm will come to your computer or your person.
I wrote the script that you will install myself. There is no unknown or foreign code that will run in the background.
Additionally, my script won't be running all the time. In fact, it only runs when you are specifically viewing an incident page in ServiceNow.
## How to install
It should be noted that while this script is theoretically usable with Firefox, it has not been tested. 
Therefore, stability and support cannot be guaranteed to Firefox users.

### For Chrome Users
